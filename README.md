# Build Intelligent applications with ML.NET and Windows Machine Learning

Need to integrate trained machine learning models into Windows apps? In this session, we will look into how Windows Machine Learning can transform applications with the power of artificial intelligence and run it on the devices by taking full advantage of hardware acceleration. We will walk thru and learn how to train a model with ML.NET Model Builder and inference with Windows Machine Learning.

## Demo: WinML and AutoML
In this example you find a Winforms, UWP and .NET MAUI application that predict prices of taxi fare.

- WinML-AutoML
 - GenerateONNX-AutoML - uses ML.NET to generate an ONNX model
 - Winforms-ONNX - Winforms app that uses ONNX Model
 - App1 - UWP project that uses ONNX Model
 - MauiApp - Maui application that uses ONNX Model
